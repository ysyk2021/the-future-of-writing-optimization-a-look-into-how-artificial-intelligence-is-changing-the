AI can be a powerful tool for optimizing writing efficiency and productivity. In this chapter, we will explore how AI can be used to boost productivity and efficiency through time management and distraction control.

### Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro technique is a time management strategy that is commonly used by writers to improve productivity. This technique involves breaking work into focused intervals of typically 25 minutes, followed by short breaks. There are several AI-enabled Pomodoro apps that can help writers manage their time and stay on task, such as the Forest app which rewards users with virtual coins for staying focused and not getting distracted.

### Distraction Blockers

Distractions can significantly impede writing progress, but AI-enabled distraction blockers can help mitigate these distractions. These tools work by blocking access to distracting websites or apps during designated writing periods. Some popular AI-enabled distraction blockers include Freedom and Cold Turkey Writer.

### Voice Recognition

Another AI technology that can be used to boost productivity and efficiency is voice recognition software. This technology allows writers to dictate their writing while keeping their hands free for other tasks, such as cooking or driving. Dragon NaturallySpeaking is one example of an AI-enabled voice recognition software that is commonly used by writers.
